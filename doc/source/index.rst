Overview
========
Python DevTools is a collection of commandline tools for working with python
codebases. I wanted to refactor code; which involved lots of global
'find-and-replace'. There are several excellent tools, but I found it difficult
to use accross multiple projects. At the same time, I was developing tools to
march over code base, to fix 'lint' errors, like bad variable names and fixing
whitespace errors. Since I wanted supervision on what these tools were doing; I 
intergrated this to allow standard merge-tools to use them.
